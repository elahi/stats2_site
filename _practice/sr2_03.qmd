## Practice

### Easy. 

These problems use the samples from the posterior distribution for the globe tossing example. This code will give you a specific set of samples, so that you can check your answers exactly.

```{r r-code-3.27, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
p_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)
prior <- rep(1, 1000)
likelihood <- dbinom(6, size = 9, prob = p_grid)
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior/sum(posterior)
set.seed(100)
samples <- sample(p_grid, prob = posterior, size = 1e4, replace = TRUE)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(samples, ylim = c(0,1))
dens(samples)
```

Use the values in `samples` to answer the questions that follow.

3E1. How much posterior probability lies below p = 0.2?
```{r 3E1}
sum(samples < 0.2) / 1e4
```
3E2. How much posterior probability lies above p = 0.8?
```{r 3E2}
sum(samples > 0.8) / 1e4
```
3E3. How much posterior probability lies between p = 0.2 and p = 0.8?
```{r 3E3}
sum(samples > 0.2 & samples < 0.8) / 1e4
```
3E4. 20% of the posterior probability lies below which value of p?
```{r 3E4}
quantile(samples, 0.2)
```
3E5. 20% of the posterior probability lies above which value of p?
```{r 3E5}
quantile(samples, 0.8)
```
3E6. Which values of p contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of the posterior probability?
```{r 3E6}
HPDI(samples, 0.66)
```
3E7. Which values of p contain 66% of the posterior probability, assuming equal posterior probability both below and above the interval?
```{r 3E7}
PI(samples, 0.66)
```
### Medium.

3M1. Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 8 water in 15 tosses. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. Use the same flat prior as before.

```{r 3M1}
n_water <- 8
n_tosses <- 15
grid_size <- 1000

p_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = grid_size)
prior <- rep(1, grid_size)
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water, size = n_tosses, prob = p_grid)
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior/sum(posterior)
set.seed(100)
plot(p_grid, posterior, type = "l")
```

3M2. Draw 10,000 samples from the grid approximation from above. Then use the samples to calculate the 90% HPDI for p.
```{r 3M2, fig.height = 3.5}
samples <- sample(p_grid, prob = posterior, size = 1e4, replace = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(samples, ylim = c(0,1))
dens(samples)
HPDI(samples, prob = 0.9)
```
3M3. Construct a posterior predictive check for this model and data. This means simulate the distribution of samples, averaging over the posterior uncertainty in p. What is the probability of observing 8 waters in 15 tosses?
```{r 3M3}
n_pred <- 1e4
w_pred <- rbinom(n_pred, size = 15, prob = samples)
simplehist(w_pred)
sum(w_pred == 8) / n_pred
```
3M4. Using the posterior distribution constructed from the new (8/15) data, now calculate the probability of observing 6 waters in 9 tosses.
```{r 3M4}
n_pred <- 1e4
w_pred <- rbinom(n_pred, size = 9, prob = samples)
simplehist(w_pred)
sum(w_pred == 6) / n_pred

## What is the probability of the true p = 0.7?
w_pred <- rbinom(n_pred, size = 10, prob = samples)
sum(w_pred == 7) / n_pred
```

3M5. Start over at 3M1, but now use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant above p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the Earthâ€™s surface is water. Repeat each problem above and compare the inferences. What difference does the better prior make? If it helps, compare inferences (using both priors) to the true value p = 0.7.
```{r 3M5}
n_water <- 8
n_tosses <- 15
grid_size <- 1000
n_samples <- 1e4

## Calculate posterior with new prior
p_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = grid_size)
prior <- ifelse(p_grid < 0.5, 0, 1)
likelihood <- dbinom(n_water, size = n_tosses, prob = p_grid)
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior/sum(posterior)
plot(p_grid, posterior, type = "l")

## Draw samples
set.seed(100)
samples <- sample(p_grid, prob = posterior, size = n_samples, replace = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(samples, ylim = c(0,1))
dens(samples)
HPDI(samples, prob = 0.9)

## Posterior predictions
n_pred <- 1e4
w_pred <- rbinom(n_pred, size = n_tosses, prob = samples)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
simplehist(w_pred)
sum(w_pred == 8) / n_pred

## Calculate probability of observing 6 waters in 9 tosses
w_pred <- rbinom(n_pred, size = 9, prob = samples)
sum(w_pred == 6) / n_pred

## What is the probability of the true p = 0.7?
w_pred <- rbinom(n_pred, size = 10, prob = samples)
sum(w_pred == 7) / n_pred
```
